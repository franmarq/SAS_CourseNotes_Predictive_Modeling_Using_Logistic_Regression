# SAS Course Notes: Predictive Modeling Using Logistic Regression

This course covers predictive modeling using SAS/STAT software with emphasis on the LOGISTIC procedure. This course also discusses selecting variables and interactions, recoding categorical variables based on the smooth weight of evidence, assessing models, treating missing values, and using efficiency techniques for massive data sets.
This notes are based in the course materials, some codes and images are copyrighted by Sas Institute. I made a Jupyter Notebook using JupiterLab with SAS University Edition.
